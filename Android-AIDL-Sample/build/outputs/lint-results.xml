        id="OldTargetApi"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details."
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Checks that the manifest specifies a targetSdkVersion that is recent"
        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version you are adding support for: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html"

    <issue
        id="AllowBackup"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Should explicitly set android:allowBackup to true or false (it&apos;s true by default, and that can have some security implications for the application&apos;s data)"
        category="Security"
        priority="3"
        summary="Ensure that allowBackup is explicitly set in the application&apos;s manifest"
        explanation="The allowBackup attribute determines if an application&apos;s data can be backed up and restored. It is documented at http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup

By default, this flag is set to `true`. When this flag is set to `true`, application data can be backed up and restored by the user using `adb backup` and `adb restore`.

This may have security consequences for an application. `adb backup` allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. `adb restore` allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.

Setting `allowBackup=&quot;false&quot;` opts an application out of both backup and restore.

To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set `android:allowBackup=(true|false)&quot;`"

        category="Usability:Icons"
        priority="3"
        summary="Ensures that all the density folders are present"
        explanation="Icons will look best if a custom version is provided for each of the major screen density classes (low, medium, high, extra high). This lint check identifies folders which are missing, such as `drawable-hdpi`.
Low density is not really used much anymore, so this check ignores the ldpi density. To force lint to include it, set the environment variable `ANDROID_LINT_INCLUDE_LDPI=true`. For more information on current density usage, see http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/screens.html"

        id="TextFields"
        severity="Warning"
        message="This text field does not specify an inputType or a hint"
        category="Usability"
        priority="5"
        summary="Looks for text fields missing `inputType` or `hint` settings"
        explanation="Providing an `inputType` attribute on a text field improves usability because depending on the data to be input, optimized keyboards can be shown to the user (such as just digits and parentheses for a phone number). Similarly,a hint attribute displays a hint to the user for what is expected in the text field.

The lint detector also looks at the `id` of the view, and if the id offers a hint of the purpose of the field (for example, the `id` contains the phrase `phone` or `email`), then lint will also ensure that the `inputType` contains the corresponding type attributes.

If you really want to keep the text field generic, you can suppress this warning by setting `inputType=&quot;text&quot;`."
